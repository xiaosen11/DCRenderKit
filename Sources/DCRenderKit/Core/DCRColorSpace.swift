/// The numerical domain used by intermediate textures and filter math.
///
/// DCRenderKit can operate in two modes. They differ in what numbers the
/// floats inside `rgba16Float` intermediates represent.
///
/// - ``perceptual``: values are sRGB-gamma encoded. Matches Harbeth's
///   historical behaviour and DigiCam's visual parity target: filters'
///   curves were fit against Lightroom-exported JPEGs whose pixels are
///   also gamma-encoded. Drawable presentation uses `.bgra8Unorm` — byte
///   values flow unchanged from the intermediate to the screen.
///
/// - ``linear``: values represent linear scene light. Source textures are
///   loaded with GPU-side sRGB→linear conversion (`MTKTextureLoader`
///   option `.SRGB: true`), math such as Reinhard tone-mapping is
///   mathematically correct in linear space, and the final drawable is
///   `.bgra8Unorm_srgb` so the GPU gamma-encodes on write. More "correct"
///   by the lights of modern imaging, but the parameter tuning done
///   against perceptual-space references (Exposure's Reinhard gain,
///   Contrast's cubic pivot, Whites/Blacks weighted parabolas, the white-
///   balance YIQ mix) shifts the effective curve shape — product "feel"
///   will drift vs. the DigiCam baseline unless the curves are refit.
///
/// ## Switching
///
/// Change `DCRenderKit.defaultColorSpace` to choose. The enum powers:
///   1. ``TextureLoader.makeTexture`` — loads with sRGB read-side conversion
///   2. ``ExposureFilter`` — picks its shader branch (pow(,2.2) in
///      perceptual mode, identity in linear mode)
///   3. ``recommendedDrawablePixelFormat`` — the right MTKView format
///      for on-screen presentation
///
/// Other filters (Contrast, Whites, Blacks, Saturation, Vibrance,
/// WhiteBalance, Sharpen, FilmGrain, CCD, HighlightShadow, Clarity,
/// SoftGlow, PortraitBlur, NormalBlend, LUT3D, SaturationRec709) have no
/// space-sensitive code; their shader math runs on whatever numeric
/// distribution the intermediate carries. "Same math, different feel" —
/// the product-side tuning is the variable, not the math.
